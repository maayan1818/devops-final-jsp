Selenium Validations

1. Page Title Validation (assert title)
    What is validated:
    The page title contains "DevOps Final Project".

    Why:
    This validation ensures that the URL loads the correct application page and not an error page (such as 404) or a different Tomcat default page.

2. Input Field Presence (assert element present)
    What is validated:
    A text input field with the name username exists on the page.

    Why:
    This confirms that the interactive UI elements are loaded correctly and that the user can enter input before starting the test flow.

3. Functional Text Output (assert text)

    What is validated:
    After clicking and submitting the input, the text "Hey maayan" appears in the expected location on the page.

    Why:
    This is a critical functional validation that verifies the JSP backend correctly receives the input, processes it, and returns a personalized response to the user.

4. Page Navigation Validation (assert title)

    What is validated:
    After clicking the About link, the page title changes to "About - DevOps Project".

    Why:
    This validation ensures that navigation between pages works correctly and that internal routing inside the web application functions as expected.
