The Max Limit test gradually increased the request rate in order to identify the maximum sustainable capacity of the application.
Up to the saturation point, successful requests maintained acceptable response times (95th percentile around ~2 seconds), indicating stable application behavior.
As the load approached ~6,600 requests per second, the failure rate increased significantly, mainly due to connection refused and connection timeout errors.
This indicates that while the application itself remained responsive, many requests failed before being fully processed.
The system reached an infrastructure limit (Tomcat / OS), where CPU, connection backlogs, or limits were exhausted.
