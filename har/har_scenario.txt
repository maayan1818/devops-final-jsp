Request 1 : The initial GET request to the dynamic index.jsp file to load the home page. The Tomcat server processes the Java code and returns a 200 OK status with the HTML content.
Request 2 : A request for the static favicon.ico file (the website's tab icon). This is triggered automatically by the browser to display the icon in the tab.
Request 3 : A second GET request to the index.jsp file. This simulates a page refresh by the user, forcing the server to re-process the dynamic backend logic.
Request 4 : A follow-up request for the favicon.ico file after the page refresh. The server typically responds with a 304 Not Modified status, as the file is already stored in the user's browser cache.
