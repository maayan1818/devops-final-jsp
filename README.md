## Project Overview
This project is a simple Java JSP web application developed as part of the DevOps final course project.

The application demonstrates a basic web flow that includes:
- A main page with styled content and user interaction
- A text input field for user input
- Navigation between pages using links
- A secondary “About” page that provides additional information about the application

The application is intentionally simple and lightweight in order to focus on DevOps practices rather than complex business logic.
